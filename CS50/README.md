This the pattern represent a decimal number which refers to a specific alphabet letter via ASCII. The pattern 01001001 stands for the letter 'I' and the total decimal representation is 73. - KB = 1000 bytes (kilo bytes), MB = 1.000.000 bytes (mega bytes), GB = 1.000.000.000 (giga bytes)With a byte pattern, you can in total represent 256 different letters or punctuation. This is not enough for all kinds of characters and letters we use as people over the world, let alone that we also send out emoji's in text messages. The emoji's are also represented by a pattern of 0 and 1's. Therefore the new used CS language is Unicode, which goes up to 32 bytes. Most used emoji is represented by the decimal number 128514![tear-laughing emoji](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/5d/52/c75d524d2bd561a23d5bf0cc2688ad48.png)### PixelA single pixel is using 3 bytes to get the right mixture of Red Green and Blue (each represented by a single byte, to get the RGB total color code).## AlgorithmsAlgorithms are the recipe / set of instructions that computers use to get from input to output. They have to be: - Correct --> to get the right output- Precise --> no room for error, as computers will follow the instruction literally.- bug = a mistake in a program  or a mistake in an algorithm. - pseudocode = language that a human can read and write which translates to a script a computer can understand- function = action for the computer to do something- abstraction = taking a complex problem and simplify it. In an algorithm it can mean that you take a complex algorithm and store this in a package that others can use to solve their problems more easily. Or break it down in simpler blocks.# Week 1 - Learning coding in CGood code needs to be correct & well designed & well styledIn order to get your source code (written in a programming language like C++, Python, R or Java for example) transferred to a machine code (output of a computer), you need a compiler. This is a program designed to convert source code to machine code. You can download this. ## Commands Terminal C- ls = list of files in current directory- rm = remove files / programs (' green *' ) - mv =rename files or move files to a foler (mv "name folder/")- mkdir = make a directory- cd = change to another directory- move to parent folder ==> mv " filename.c"  ..- Change to parent directory ==> cd ..- ./"filename"  => file in current directory## Most important formats for printing C++ using printf()- %c = single character- %f = decimal number / float- %i = integer- %s = string- %li = long integer## Operators in C++- (+)  Plus  / add- (-) Minus / subtract- (*) multiply- (/)  divide- (%) remainer# Week 2 - more about C- Compiler program is 'clang' ## Compiling consists of 4 steps:- Preprocessing: look for the #-symbol lines to define all functions- Compiling: take the source code and transfer this to assembly code (which a CPU understands)- Assembling: take the assembly code and transfer this to binary (=machine) code, which means zeros and ones. - Linking: linking all libraries that are used to each other# Week 3 - Algorithm- Hertz = one something per second- Runningtime = how long an algorithm takes. The O stands for the upper bound, the Omega sign for the lower bound. - Searching linear = go over an 'array' from left to right, one step at a time to find the required outcome. - Recursion = ability of a function to call itself- Recursive searching --> use merge sort, which states:`if only one number; quit;else;sort left half;sort right half;merge sorted halves;`If the upper bound and the lower bound are identical, you describe them using theta 'θ'. This is the case for Selection sort and merge sort. # Week 4 --> memory- Base-16 = numbers 0-9 and A-F, this is a Hexa-decimal way of allocating bytes in a computer memory. Hex = 16, so 16-characters to count. - one hexa-decimal digit is equivalent to 4 binary digits (=bits 1 or 0). - Hexa-decimal is noted via '#' and 6 characters (0-9 or A-F)- '&' = address of operator (change to %p to print the address)- '*' = dereference operator and means go to a specific address
