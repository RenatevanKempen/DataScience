Hi, and welcome to my notes about the Stanford CS50 course. Here are some terms that are explained. # Computer language explained:Computers use a binary language to read and write: - Binary consists of 0 or 1- bit = a single zero or one (0 or 1)- byte = pattern of 8 bits in a row, like 01001001. This the pattern represent a decimal number which refers to a specific alphabet letter via ASCII. The pattern 01001001 stands for the letter 'I' and the total decimal representation is 73.
