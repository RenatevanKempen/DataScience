# My Data Science Journey

Hello to you all!

My name is Renate van Kempen and this repo represents the culmination of my data science career learnings.

My goal is to: 
1. Map out the necessary skills a Data Scientist needs and uses daily
2. Showcase all specific learnings

### So far I've learned about:
- OOP = Object Oriented Programming
- Vision AI and Computer Vision
- Voice AI and building voicebots in DialogFlow with a webhook (Python)
- How to use TensorFlow in a project
- Webscraping with Selenium, Scrapy and Beautiful Soup
- NLP = Natural Language Processing

I'm convinced that I will never stop learning ;-)!!

Should you have anything that could be interesting, feel free to contact me via [email](renate@baime.nl)

Kind Regards, Renate
