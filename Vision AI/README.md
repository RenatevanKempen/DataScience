# Vision A.I. 
This repo is used to collect all information I find interesting and usefull about Computer Vision.
Should you have any information you want to share, contact me (Renate) via [email](renate@baime.nl). 

## Computer Vision explained
Computer vision is a field of study focused on the problem of helping computers to see.

Computer Vision strives to help artificial systems understand images. All sorts of computers, camera's and devices need to be able to both analyse and interpret images. Images consists of photo's and videos. In the end the systems should be able to make indepent decisions based on the interpretation of the images. The tasks the human visual system performs can be done by an artificial system, much more efficient. Therefore this is a great business opportunity, it could automate a lot of manual and costly labor. 

## How does Computer Vision work? 
Computer Vision is based on deep learning. This is a subset of machine learning and uses a neural network architecture, just like a human brain. Deep learning strives to enable a system to predict and make decisions based on context. 

## From unstructured data to objects
Images consist of many pixels, therefore unstructured data. Artificial systems will transform this into a structered dataset. Human brains do this automatically, but the systems need a step-by-step plan. The first step is to search for certain characteristics in the image. These characteristics are communicated to the system, this is the input for Computer Vision. examples are shapes, edges and colors. Together they form an object. Once a system knows these characteristics, the precize object can be traced within the image. Secondly the system can see where the object is within the image and how many objects there are. Thirdly the system can determine the status and the quality of the object. 

## Not Image Processing
Computer vision is distinct from image processing. Image processing is the process of creating a new image from an existing image, typically simplifying or enhancing the content in some way. It is a type of digital signal processing and is not concerned with understanding the content of an image. Computer Vision is the extend of Image Processing, as it uses the given assumptions of the surroundings as input and the selfmade decisions are the output. For example if a robot with a camera is dropped out of a plane, it can process the images with tags, such as 'sea' and 'mountains' but with Computer Vision it can make decisions to not land in sea, as it can not swim. 

## Facial Recognition
Computer Vision nowadays is mainly used for facial recognition. Think about the tags propositions you see in social media or the passport controle at the e-gates of an airport. Facial recognition compares the analyzed data with a certain database, same as for fingerprints. The success of facial recognition depends on the size of the database and the quality of the image. 

## 3D object recognition
In computer vision, 3D object recognition involves recognizing and determining 3D information, such as the pose, volume, or shape, of user-chosen 3D objects in a photograph or range scan. Typically, an example of the object to be recognized is presented to a vision system in a controlled environment, and then for an arbitrary input such as a video stream, the system locates the previously presented object.
