# Polygons

My name is Renate van Kempen and this repo explains more about the use of polygons via Python in apps or on maps.
Polygons are two-dimensional shapes. They are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed", so all lines are connected.
A regular polygon has all angles equal and all sides equal, otherwise it is irregular. See [MathisFun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/polygons.html) for an explanation with examples.
