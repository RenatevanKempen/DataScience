#My question was:
How to replace a ',' in a column with a string (ex '-58,00') with a '.' in python (like find&replace in excel)?

#Additional information: 
I'm trying to get more insights of my bank data. 
I want to look at the total sum per category, but I can't seem to make a float of the amounts in the dataset.

I've uploaded the data (csv-file) into a dataframe (bank), that looks something like this:

 date        amount   category
 2018-09-01  -58,00   dinner 
 2018-09-02  -60,00   grocery
 2018-09-02  -115,00  clothing
I've tried to use .replace and .astype(float), both didn't work

#I've tried this formula, but it doesn't work (the x-values even get shuffled??): 

#replace ',' with '.' in amount:
def komma(x):
    for x in bank['amount']:
        x = list(set(x))
        for a in x:
            if a == ',':
                a.replace(",",".")
    return "".join(x)

komma(x)
bank.head()

#my result with .replace(',','.') is no changes in the dataframe 
#my result with .astype(float) was 
#ValueError: could not convert string to float: '-58,00'

#The correct code (thus the answer) was (thanks to Grzegorz Skibinski):
df["amount"]=df["amount"].str.replace(",", ".").astype(float)
#(no need for a loop here)
