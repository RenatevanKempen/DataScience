#The assignment: 
Use the BeautifulSoup and requests Python packages to print out a list of all the article titles on the New York Times homepage.

#Their solution:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 
base_url = 'http://www.nytimes.com'
r = requests.get(base_url)
for story_heading in soup.find_all(class_="story-heading"): 
    if story_heading.a: 
        print(story_heading.a.text.replace("\n", " ").strip())
    else: 
        print(story_heading.contents[0].strip())
        


#for me this solution didn't seem to work as on the site they have replaced 'storyheading' with 'css-1w0yruz esl82me0' 
#(different code per article title). 

#so my try:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import string

url = 'https://www.nytimes.com'
r = requests.get(url)
r_html = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(r_html, 'html.parser')

x = []
for b in soup.find_all('h2'):
    x.append(b.string)
print(x)
