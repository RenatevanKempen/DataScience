## Welcome to the REPO about Voice AI. 

I've been working on building several voicebots for both personal and business usages. 
In this repo I'll share the code I've made (only for those projects that are not under a NDA). 

Also you will find information that I found helpfull to make all the bots here. 

- [Good and clear tutorial](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/dialogflow-fulfillment-webhook-tutorial-7cf4ceba0e5e) on how to make a webhook for Google Dialogflow using Python and NGrok
- [Nice explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzccjhAuqBo) of the difference between regular follow-up's and webhook in Google Dialogflow by [Naresh Ganatra](https://github.com/nareshganatra)
- [Various JSON formats](https://github.com/pragnakalp/dialogflow-webhook-response-libary-in-python) for webhook can be accessed via a simple import in Python. 
- [A tutorial](https://www.pragnakalp.com/dialogflow-tutorial-create-fulfillment-webhook-using-python-django/) to create a fulfillment webhook for DialogFlow using Python and Django

 

## Acces to a web UI
- You can easily subscribe and download a free plan for [ngrok here](https://ngrok.com/)

You only need to install flask in Python first
```python
 pip install flask
 ```


Should you have any tips or anything to add here, send me an [email](renate@baime.nl). 

Kind regards, 

Renate van Kempen
